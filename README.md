# ANNDL_ImageClassificationChallenge
Repo containing the results of the challenge1 of the course Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning @ Politecnico di Milano, in which my team and I ranked 2nd over more than 150 teams and 600 partecipants. Pinguino!


The task was to classify images of plants in 2 classes: healthy, unhealthy. 
Lots of fun!
